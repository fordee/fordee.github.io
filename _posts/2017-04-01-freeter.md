[Freeter](https://freeter.io/) is a great new app for the Mac / Windows / Linux for simplifying your workflow. It is essentially a dashboard into your projects.

A [freeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeter) in Japan is a young person who typically lives at home and works in low paying temporary jobs. As opposed to the salaryman, a freeter lives a life of less stress, moving between jobs and leisure at will. I'm not sure if this is how this product got its name, but it kinda fits.

## Dashboard

When you start Freeter you have a blank dashboard for your projects. Each project can have their own dashboard where you can add:
* Command buttons
* File Explorers
* To Do Lists
* Interactive Web Pages

When developing [Colourinz](/colourinz/), I used [Freeter](https://freeter.io/) extensively. Apart from keeping track of to do items and bugs (through [You Track](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) by Jet Brains), I used it to fire off scripts to generate screenshots and upload them to the App Store or start a beta build and upload that.

I have several side projects that I use [Freeter](https://freeter.io/) to pull everything together. I can work on one of these projects and then do nothing for months. [Freeter](https://freeter.io/) allows me to come back to it and pick up where I left off.

So if you have trouble keeping your side projects on track, you should take a look at [Freeter](https://freeter.io/).
