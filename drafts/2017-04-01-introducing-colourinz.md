After many months of development, we are please to introduce Colourinz to the App Store.

## History

Colourinz started as real wold analog coloring for adults pictures sold on large paper. The designs where by Carl VanWijk and the name Colourinz came from the spelling of colour in New Zealand (with the extra 'u') and NZ being home to Carl and John.

## The App!

It seemed a pity that in this digital age that you couldn't use an iPad or iPhone to colour in the drawings. So John decided to create an app for the Apple App Store. Colourinz the app was born!
